         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THus we deſire to give unto Chriſt that which is his, and unto all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority that which is their due, and to owe nothing to any man but love, to live quietly and peaceably, as it becommeth Saints, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in all things to keep a good conſcience, and to doe unto every man (of what judgement ſoever) as we would they ſhould doe unto us, that as our practice is, ſo it may prove us to be a conſcionable, quiet, and barmleſſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (no wayes dangerous or troubleſome to humane Society) and to labour and work with our hands that we may not be chargeable to any, but to give to him that needeth both friends and enemies, accounting it more excellent to give then to receive. Alſo we confeſſe that we know but in part, and that we are ignorant of many things which we deſire and ſeek to know: and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall doe us that friendly part to ſhew us from the word of God that wee ſee not, we ſhall have cauſe to be thankfull to God and them. But if any man ſhall impoſe upon us any thing that we ſee not to be commanded by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhould in his ſtrength rather embrace all reproaches and tortures of men, to be ſtript of all outward comforts, and if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to die a thouſand deaths, rather then to doe any thing againſt the leaſt tittle of the truth of God, or againſt the light of our own conſciences. And if any ſhal call what we have ſaid Hereſie, then do we with the Apoſtle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that after the way they call hereſie, worſhip we the God of our Fathers, diſclaiming all Hereſies (rightly ſo called) becauſe they are againſt Chriſt, &amp; to be ſtedfaſt and immoveable, alwayes abounding in obedience to Chriſt, as knowing our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
